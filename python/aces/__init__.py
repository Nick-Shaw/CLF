ACES Python Utilities
=====================

Usage
-----

Python
******

>>> from aces_ocio.create_aces_config import create_ACES_config
>>> aces_CTL_directory = '/path/to/github/checkout/releases/v1.0.0/transforms/ctl'
>>> config_directory = '/path/to/configuration/dir'
>>> create_ACES_config(aces_CTL_directory, config_directory, 1024, 33, True)

Command Line
************

Using the *create_aces_config* binary:

$ create_aces_config -a '/path/to/github/checkout/releases/v0.7.1/transforms/ctl' -c '/path/to/config/dir' --lutResolution1d 1024 --lutResolution3d 33 --keepTempImages

It is possible to set the following environment variables to avoid passing
the paths to the binary:

- *ACES_OCIO_CTL_DIRECTORY*
- *ACES_OCIO_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY*

The above command line call would be done as follows:

$ create_aces_config --lutResolution1d 1024 --lutResolution3d 33 --keepTempImages

Testing the generated configuration is needs the
*ACES_OCIO_CTL_DIRECTORY* environment variable to be set and is done as
follows:

$ tests_aces_config
